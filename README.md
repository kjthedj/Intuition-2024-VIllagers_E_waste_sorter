Problem statement: Efficient Sorting and Repurposing of E-Waste for Sustainable Resource Management

Description of Problem:-
In today's technology-driven world, the exponential growth of electronic devices has led to a parallel surge in electronic waste (e-waste). The improper disposal and management of e-waste pose significant environmental and health hazards due to the presence of toxic materials such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. To mitigate these risks and promote sustainability, there is a pressing need for efficient sorting and repurposing techniques for e-waste.
